Functional roadmap for version 1.0
====================================

 [x] Build a new distro from a Drush make file.
   [x] core
   [x] projects
   [ ] patches
   [ ] libraries

 [ ] Update a distro from a Drush make file.

 [ ] Check for available distro releases.

 [ ] Update / rollback distro based on release number. `drush git-make update [project] 1.1`
     (e.g. I have the make file for version 1.0 locally. See that 1.1 is available. Then
     update to 1.1 without having to know complicated git subtree work flow.)
